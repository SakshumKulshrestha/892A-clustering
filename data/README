Supplementary data sets:
========================

	60species.fas: sequences derived from the V6 region of 60 different 
species. Two of them have the same sequence, hence corresponding to 59 OTUs
at 3% dissimilarity (Materials and Methods).

	60x50.fas: same sequences as above, repeated 50 times each. Used to
check richness estimation as a function of the OTU/sequence number ratio.

	60x50mutinter.fas: sequence dataset generated from 60species.fas.
Each sequence was mutated 50 times to produce 50 derivatives, each of them 
containing only one independent single point mutation or indel, and arranged
interleaving mutants and species. E.g. if 60species contained S1, S2.. S60
this file would contain S1-mutant1, S2-mutant1, ... S59-mutant50, S60-mutant50.

	60x50mutstack.fas: sequence dataset generated from 60species.fas.
Each sequence was mutated 50 times to produce 50 derivatives, each of them
containing only one indpendent single point mutation or indel, and arranged
stacking all 50 derives sequences one after the other. E.g. if 60 species
contained S1, S2.. S60, this file would contain S1-mutant1, S1-mutant2...
S60-mutant49, S60mutant50.

	Control-t1.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Control
sample at time 1.

	Control-t2.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Control
sample at time 2.

	Glyphosate-t1.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Sample
from Glyphosate treated soil at time 1.

	Glyphosate-t2.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Sample
from Glyphosate treated soil at time 2.

	GTZ-t1.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Sample
from GTZ treated soil at time 1.

	GTZ-t2.fas: dataset for differential richness estimation. Sample
from GTZ treated soil at time 2.

	Hao_skin_axillary_hv5.fas: reconstruction of Hao's dataset of axillary 
skin samples.

	Huse_gb_2007_8_7_r143_s2: Huse’s dataset

	QuinceArtficialGSFLXClean.fas: Quince's artificial dataset.

	QuincePriestPotGSFLXClean.fas: Quince's Priest Pot soil dataset.

	Youssef.fas: reconstruction of Youssef's dataset.
